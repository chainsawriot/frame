# Frame

**Entmanian Frame:** "Select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation for the item described."

**Chan's restatement:** Frame is the result of an act of **selecting** certain aspects of a perceived reality by a communicator, whose **intention** is to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evalution, and/or treatment recommendation.
