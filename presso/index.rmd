**Entmanian Frame:** "Select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation for the item described."

**Chan's restatement:** Frame is the result of an act of **selecting** certain aspects of a perceived reality by a communicator, whose **intention** is to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evalution, and/or treatment recommendation.

# What actually is frame detection?

.extralarge[
* Evaluate which aspects of a perceived reality are selected?
* Guess the communicator's intention?

# Zum Mitnehmen

.pull-left[
* Frame detection is not the same as finding topics (Carragee & Roefs, 2004)

* Detection of communicative intention from text is crazily hard, even human can't do it well. But..
